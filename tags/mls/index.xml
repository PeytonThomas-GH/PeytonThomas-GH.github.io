      <description>Following the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the U.S Soccer Federation decided it was the right time to create a Divison 1 soccer league within the country. Starting play in 1996 with 8 teams, MLS has now completed 26 seasons through 2020 and expanded to a whopping 27 clubs with plans to extend out to 30 by the 2023 season.
Through that history, the league has seen a number of aggressive, tough, and physical players pass through the ranks, coming from different countries across the globe.</description>
