      <description>Recently across the soccer world, fans have been accustomed to an “Expected Goals(xG)” metric attached to both sides in any particular match. xG represents how many goals that team should be expected to score over the course of the game.

      <description>Following the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the U.S Soccer Federation decided it was the right time to create a Division 1 soccer league within the country. Starting play in 1996 with 10 teams, Major League Soccer has now completed 25 seasons and expanded to a whopping 27 clubs, with plans out to 30 by the 2023 season.
Throughout that history, the league has seen a number of aggressive, tough, and physical players pass through the ranks, coming from different countries across the globe.</description>
